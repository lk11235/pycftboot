This is a tutorial that applies conformal bootstrap logic with PyCFTBoot to make
non-trivial statements about four different conformal field theories. These are
taken from the examples in section 4 of arXiv:1602.02810. More information can
be found by reading the other sections or the documentation strings of PyCFTBoot.
These can be accessed by running `pydoc -g`.
